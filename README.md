# RAG with Llama 3.1 in Google Colab

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** framework using the **Llama 3.1** large language model in a Google Colab environment. The project integrates advanced LLM capabilities with retrieval-based techniques to enhance knowledge generation and question-answering tasks.
